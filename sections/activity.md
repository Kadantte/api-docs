Several types of activites are available via this endpoint. They are described in the `activitytype` field. 

**Edits** refers to the number of times the descriptive data for an object has changed on a given day. This gives you no indication of what specifically has changed. 

**Pageviews** refers to the number of times an object was visited on the [museum's public website](http://www.harvardartmuseums.org) on a given day.

**Unique Pageviews** refers to the number of unique times an object was visited on the [museum's public website](http://www.harvardartmuseums.org) on a given day. This number is equal to or lower than pageviews.

**Conservation** refers to the number of times an object had a conservation report written about on a given day.

**Moves** refers to the number of times an object was physically moved on a given day. A move could be from one storage to location to another storage location. It could be storage to a gallery and so on.
