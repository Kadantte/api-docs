## Get Image

`GET /image/IMAGE_ID` will get the full record of the specified image.

A record represents the concept of an image. An image can be represented by one or more files that are accessible via one or more services.

**imageid** describes the numeric unique identifier for a record    

**idsid** describes the unique numeric identifier for a file in the Harvard Digital Repository  

**fileid** describes the unique numeric identifier for a file  

**renditionnumber** describes the unique name for the image; this often takes the form of a prefix + serial number; the prefix can provide hints as to when, why, and how we made the image   

**date** describes either the date of creation of the image record in our collections management system OR the date of creation of the image itself (this is very fuzzy data)  

**baseimageurl** describes the primary internet address for the image and is delivered through our [default image delivery service](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs#default-service)  

**iiifbaseuri** describes the root of the address for accessing the image through our [IIIF image delivery service](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs#iiif)  

**format** describes the [media type/MIME type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) of the image (typically image/jpeg)  

**alttext** describes the most relevant, prominent features or general characteristics of the image  
 
**description** describes the image content in detail  

**caption** describes the image, often listing more technical information about the view (recto, verso, profile, 3/4 view)  

**technique** describes the photography equipment and software used during the production of the image  

**colors** describes the colors programmatically extracted from the image  
An image may have zero or more colors. The color of each pixel is read and then sorted in to buckets. Brightness and gradient variants are reduced so similar colors group together, and to keep the number of buckets under 20. Then those colors are mapped to the [museums' color palette](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs/blob/master/sections/spectrum.md), the CSS3 color listing, and hue names.  

`percent` - is the amount, between the range of 0 to 1, of the color found in the image  
`color` - is the color found in the image  
`spectrum` - is the closest match of the color value to the museums' design color [spectrum](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs/blob/master/sections/spectrum.md)  
`css3` - is the closest match to the colors listed in the [CSS3 color module specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/)  
`hue` - is the color value mapped to the name of a hue (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, Brown, Grey, Black, White)
